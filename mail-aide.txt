# These settings are mainly for the wrapper scripts around aide,
# such as aideinit and dailyaidecheck

# Main configuration file
CONFIG="/etc/aide/aide.conf"

# Set this to no to disable daily aide runs
#CRON_DAILY_RUN=yes

# The following variables control the sending of e-mail reports from
# the daily aide check. See /usr/share/doc/aide-common/README.Debian
# for detailed documentaton. Commented out settings are the default.
FQDN=AIDEServer
MAILSUBJ="Daily AIDE report for $FQDN"
MAILTO="hacermuden@gmail.com"
MAILCMD="s-nail"
MAILWIDTH=990

# Set this to yes to suppress mailings when no changes have been
# detected during the AIDE run and no error output was given.
#QUIETREPORTS=no

# Set this to yes to suppress mailings under all circumstances
# This option implies QUIETREPORTS=yes
#SILENTREPORTS=no

# Set this to no if you have figlet installed but do not want figlet
# output in your daily aide check mail
#FIGLET=yes

# This parameter defines which AIDE command to run from the daily aide check.
# Sensible values are "update" and "check".
# Default is "check", ensuring backwards compatibility.
# Since "update" does not take any longer, it is recommended to use "update",
# so that a new database is created every day. The new database needs to be
# manually copied over the current one, though.
COMMAND=update

# This parameter defines what to do with a new database created by
# COMMAND=update. It is ignored if COMMAND!=update.
# no: Do not copy new database to old database. This is the default.
# yes: Copy new database to old database. This means that changes to the
#   file system are only reported once. Possibly dangerous.
# ifnochange: Copy new database to old database if no changes have
#   been reported. This is needed for ANF/ARF to work reliably.
COPYNEWDB=no

# Set this to yes to truncate the detailed changes part in the mail. The full
# output will still be listed in the log file.
TRUNCATEDETAILS=no

# Set this to yes to suppress file changes by package and security
# updates from appearing in the e-mail report. Filtered file changes will
# still be listed in the log file. This option parses the /var/log/dpkg.log
# file and implies TRUNCATEDETAILS=yes
FILTERUPDATES=no

# Set this to yes to suppress file changes by package installations
# from appearing in the e-mail report. Filtered file changes will still
# be listed in the log file. This option parses the /var/log/dpkg.log file and
# implies TRUNCATEDETAILS=yes.
FILTERINSTALLATIONS=no

# This parameter defines how many lines to return per e-mail. Output longer
# than this value will be truncated in the e-mail sent out.
# Set value to "0" to disable this option.
LINES=1000

# This parameter gives a grep regular expression. If given, all output lines
# that _don't_ match the regexp are listed first in the script's output. This
# allows to easily remove noise from the AIDE report.
NOISE=""

# This parameter defines which options are given to aide in the daily
# aide check. The default is "-V4".
AIDEARGS=""

# Set this to a command that will be executed before the daily aide check
# exits. This can be used to postprocess the generated report.
# If the command is not in /sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin (see PATH
# setting in the daily aide check), you need to give a fully qualified
# path. The script is executed before the aide lock is released.
# The hook is called with a single parameter meaning:
#    signal: The daily aide check was terminated by a signal
#    fatal: There was a fatal error
#    nolock: The lock could not be obtained
#    cantmovetmp: It was not possible to move away the temporary directory
#    cantcreatetmp: It was not possible to create the temporary directory
#    success: aide finished successfully and gave meaningful results
#    unknown: onexit was called with an illegal reason (should not happen)
# If the daily aide check aborted before the environment was fully set up,
# "early-" is prepended to the reason.
CRONEXITHOOK=""
